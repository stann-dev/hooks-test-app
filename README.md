# OMDB Video Search app

Project created in less than 4 hours of work, for personal purposes. (Testing how hooks work)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Final thoughts

I think that I should split more elements into components, create some better styles and do alot more things, but I've had not enough time.
